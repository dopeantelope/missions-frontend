## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React, Node.js, Tailwind, Socketio


## Optimizations

Further optimizations I would like to implement would be having categories for missions that users can toggle depending on where they are playing. Ability to add custom missions, settings for user to choose number of missions and mission resets.

## Lessons Learned:

- [x] Socketio
